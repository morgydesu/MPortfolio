# Morgan Schmidt | Product Portfolio 🚀

This is more than a portfolio; it's a demonstration of my approach to building technical products. 
I built this site using [Your Framework - e.g., Astro & Tailwind] to focus on speed, accessibility, and clean architecture.

## 🛠 The Product Thesis
As a Product Builder with a background in Design Computing (USYD) and Tech Consulting (Telstra), I believe the best products sit at the intersection of:
1. **Technical Feasibility:** Knowing what can be built (and the effort required).
2. **User Empathy:** Understanding the "Jobs to be Done" through UX research.
3. **Business ROI:** Prioritizing features that move the needle on efficiency or revenue.

## 📦 What's Inside?
- **Case Study: Telstra Marketing Automation:** How I pivoted from a consultant to a "product owner" to build an internal tool that saved X hours/week.
- **Case Study: Chillist:** A deep dive into mobile UX and MVP scoping.
- **Experimental Lab:** Small UI components and creative coding snippets.

## 🚀 Performance & Optimization
- **Lighthouse Score:** 100/100 (Performance, SEO, Best Practices).
- **Architecture:** Component-driven design for scalability.
- **Deployment:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions/Vercel.
